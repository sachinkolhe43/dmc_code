                HTML elements are positioned static by default.
Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:
This <div> element has position: static;
Here is the CSS that is used:

            </article>
        </section>
        <aside>
            this is aside tag
        </aside>
        <footer>This is footer</footer>
    </body>
